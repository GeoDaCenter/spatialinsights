# Introduction {-}

This is bookdown we seek to find effective ways for translating philosophy of science and history of science to improve the practice of computational social science research and teaching. 
As computational thinking and data engineering have been gaining prominence in our fields of economics, public policy and geography to help analyze larger and more complex data, we increasingly see the need to re-introduce and translate scientific reasoning, theory building, and research design to this new context to avoid descriptive, expected and unreliable results.     

It is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation.

The **bookdown** package can be installed from CRAN or Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")
# or the development version
# devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.


  
To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
