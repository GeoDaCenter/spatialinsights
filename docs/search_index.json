As computational thinking and data engineering have been gaining prominence in our fields of economics, public policy and geography to help analyze larger and more complex data, we increasingly see the need to re-introduce and translate scientific reasoning, theory building, and research design to this new context to avoid descriptive, expected and unreliable results. It is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation. The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/.

As computational thinking and data engineering have been gaining prominence in our fields of economics, public policy and geography to help analyze larger and more complex data, we increasingly see the need to re-introduce and translate scientific reasoning, theory building, and research design to this new context to avoid descriptive, expected and unreliable results. You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2020) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015).

As a team of social science faculty and executive directors at UChicago who are relying on (spatial) statistical and computational analysis of data in our teaching and research, we embrace the analysis of bigger data and more powerful computation. However, a challenge we have been observing in this context is that computational and statistical tools often embody ways of reasoning that are not explicitly thought about – or sometimes there is a direct assumption that an engineering mode of reasoning applies to all problems. Assumptions that big data and computation are replacing the need for scientific reasoning and philosophy of science altogether are a purist example – such as (Anderson 2008) argument for “the end of theory and the scientific method in the age of big data.” Other examples include the push to “let the data speak for themselves,” as embodied in some automated data analysis cases (Demiralp et a. 2017) or approaches that are primarily data-driven and atheoretical.
